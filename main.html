        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I realize that saying, life is what you make it, is true. Everyday I wake up a little more excited because I have conquered a discouraging belief and replaced it with loving compassionate truth.</p>
        <p>Each day I surprise myself. I'm not saying I'm always happy; but I definitely have a growth mindset. It has taken time but through facing obstacles I fuel myself to continue moving forward.</p>
        <p>Is this too much information to share as I'm looking for a job in my field as a software developer? I've decided that it isn't too much, I want to feel excited to come to work knowing I can be myself, my whole bubbly, enthusiastic, intelligent self.</p>
        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p>My hobbies include poetry, coding, and arts and crafts such as crocheting, drawing, and watercolor. I'm very passionate about expressing creativity through creating visuals. Other fulfulling activities I participate in are hiking, running and attending free art and culture events. </p>
        <h4>Future Aspirations</h4>
        <p>I want to keep with growing and learning so that I may continue to be an asset for my (future) team. I know I'm capable of great things; I look forward to bringing those things into fruition with the support of family, friends and coworkers.</p>
